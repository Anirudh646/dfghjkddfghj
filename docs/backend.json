    "reasoning": "The Firestore structure is designed to store contact entries with a focus on individual user ownership. Each user has a dedicated collection of contact entries, ensuring data isolation and simplified security rules. The `contacts/{contactId}` collection is used to store the actual contact entry data, including the name, contact number, and date/time the information was recorded.  This design achieves Authorization Independence by storing each contact entry within a user-specific collection. Since access control is based on path ownership (`/users/{userId}/contacts/{contactId}`), security rules can be enforced without relying on `get()` calls to parent documents.  This structure facilitates simple, robust, and easily debuggable security rules, aligning with the principle of Authorization Independence. The structure inherently supports QAPs, as `list` operations are naturally scoped to the individual user's collection, ensuring only authorized contact entries are returned."
